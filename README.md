# MainBatchDownloader
Note: this requires that YT doesn't block you IP or similar, while the script is running. If the job breaks, you could perhaps start script again and YT-DLP will probably log "video X has already been downloaded" or similar.
But you could do xlookups and figure out where job broke and iterate over remainig IDs. See other repo for that script
